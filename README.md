# Mobile Phone E-Commerce Store
## PHP -CodeIgniter

3rd Year Group Project with one other student. 
Built using Mac and PC.

Learning to use CodeIgniter was a fast process which enabled fast development of CRUD functionality.
The small footprint of CodeIgniter helped speed up the run-time compared to Symfonyâ€™s larger footprint that we tested in an earlier phase.

We enabled users to compare mobile phones using Highcharts.js.
We added Paypal integration, search-filtering of products, and web services (SOAP,REST,RSS).
